 *
 * - Indentations are 2px
 * - Columns are 120px wide
 * - Don't use [] in html inside class="" for grouping
 * - In html class="" don't use 2 space between classes, but put the related ones next to each other
 * - Low level commenting is not necessary but u can use, just try to explain the things u think is important
